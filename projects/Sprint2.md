## Inspiration

Cat ipsum dolor sit amet, attempt to leap between furniture but woefully miscalibrate and bellyflop onto the floor; what's your problem? i meant to do that now i shall wash myself intently, swipe at owner's legs and jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves. Pee in human's bed until he cleans the litter box groom forever, stretch tongue and leave it slightly out, blep yet sit in a box for hours scamper, so do i like standing on litter cuz i sits when i have spaces, my cat buddies have no litter i live in luxury cat life.
